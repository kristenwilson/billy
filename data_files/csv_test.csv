The Oscura Mountains Colorado chipmunk (Neotamias quadrivittatus oscuraensis) occurs in central New Mexico and is of conservation concern due to its relict distribution and threats to habitat. We previously created an occupancy model for this taxon, but were concerned that the model may not have adequately captured the ecological factors influencing the chipmunk’s distribution because of the data hungry nature of occupancy modeling. MaxEnt is another SDM method that is particularly effective at testing large numbers of variables and handling small sample sizes. Our goal was to create a MaxEnt model for the Oscura Mountains Colorado chipmunk and to compare it with our previous occupancy model for this taxon, either to strengthen our original assessment of the relevant ecological factors or identify additional factors that were not captured by our occupancy model. We created MaxEnt models using occurrence records from baited camera traps and opportunistic surveys. We adjusted model complexity using a novel method for tuning both the regularization multiplier and feature class parameters while also performing variable selection. We compared the distribution maps and variables selected by MaxEnt to the results of our occupancy model for this taxon. The MaxEnt and occupancy models selected similar environmental variables and the overall spatial pattern of occurrence was similar for each model. Likelihood of occurrence was positively related to elevation, piñon woodland vegetation type, and topographic variables associated with escarpments. The overall similarities between the MaxEnt and occupancy models increased our confidence of the ecological factors influencing the distribution of the chipmunk. We conclude that MaxEnt offers advantages for predicting the distribution of rare species, which can help inform conservation actions.","2019","2024-01-26 16:29:06","2024-01-26 16:29:06","","","","4","101","","","","","","","","","","English","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They are usually seen in pairs, or in family groups during the summer and early fall. Although they can be hard to find at times during the spring and summer as they forage silently, more often they announce their presence by their harsh calls. During the winter, titmice are a frequent component of foraging flocks and are often the first to announce the presence of a potential predator. Titmice are early nesters, often having fledglings out of the nest at the height of migration","2014","2024-01-26 16:32:35","2024-01-26 16:32:35","","254","","","","Book, Section","","","","","","","University of Texas Press","","English","","","","","","","DOI: 10.7560/713499.125","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A multi-channel sound and video collage, Parakeet Logic is an allegorical representation of an absurd attempt for self-understanding in a conspicuously excessive and connected society. The result is a bricolage created from a “library” of objects, texts, sounds, videos, conversations, experiments, and observations. Parakeet Logic is a spiraling multi-channel sound and video collage, combining trash aesthetics, podcast logic, and amateur video. Drawing from location-based DIY counterculture, Parakeet Logic is a satirical journey through our technological fetishes, our search for authentic relationships, and the tangles between. Parakeet Logic is formed by collected language filtered and activated through Craigslist collaborations, handheld video experiments, and a significant repository of things collected over the past two years. These materials are amassed, reduced, and spewed into a study of weird harmonies where some things seem significant, but are actually equalized.","2015","2024-06-14 15:26:20","2024-06-14 15:26:20","","","","","","","","","","","","","ProQuest Dissertations Publishing","","English","","","","","","","ISBN: 9781339160177;133916017X; Dissertation/Thesis","","","","Cinematography; Fine arts","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
